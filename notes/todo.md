## Mobile Cart

Right now, the mobile cart dialog is positioned over the carousel. However, I believe the intended behavior is to have the dialog appear under the header. The header should be sticky: it needs to be positioned above the page at all times.

Doing this will allow the user to easily the cart no matter where they are in the page. The current behavior means that when the user scrolls down to the "Add to Cart" button, they have to scroll back up to actually see the cart.
